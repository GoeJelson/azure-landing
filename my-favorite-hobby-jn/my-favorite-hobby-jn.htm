			<h4>The Beginning</h4>
			<p>For my hobby I wanted to talk about video games! I have been playing video games all my life. 
			My father owned a PS2 when I was a child and that was what I primarily grew up on. As I got older and access
			to my own money I was able to invest into a gaming computer, it was at this time that my intrest began to grow 
			exponentially. Below are just a few of the games I have played competitivelty and how many hours I have spent 
			playing the game</p>
			<div>
			<table style="width:40%">
			  <tr>
				<th>Game</th>
				<th>Hours Played</th>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Counter Strike</td>
				<td>1,253.3 Hours</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Rainbow Six Seige</td>
				<td>2093.5 hours</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Rocket League</td>
				<td>292.6 hours</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
			</div>
			<p>These games and more can all be found here for purchase and download

			<p>Getting into gaming isn't difficult at all! There are several ways to playe games that don't require an expensive gaming computer, such as...</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mobile Phones - everyone has one, and you can play a variety of games!</li>
				<li>XBOX - a classic and standard gaming console</li>
				<li>PS4 - a classic and standard gaming console</li>
				<li>Nintendo Switch - a classic and standard gaming console</li>
				<li>Gaming Computer - This is my preffered to play, so I had to add it!</li>
			</ul>
			
				<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
